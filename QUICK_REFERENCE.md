## The Seven Commits

| # | Commit | Layer | File | Purpose |
|---|--------|-------|------|---------|
| 1 | Types | Foundation | `types.ts` | All interfaces and types |
| 2 | Context Graph | Layer 1 | `context-graph-engine.ts` | Deep contextual modeling |
| 3 | Appraisal | Layer 2 | `appraisal-engine.ts` | Emotional prediction |
| 4 | Perspective | Layer 3 | `perspective-taking-module.ts` | Customer understanding |
| 5 | Linguistic Mapper | Layer 4 Part 1 | `emotional-linguistic-mapper.ts` | Pattern library |

## The Flow

```
Conversation → Context Graph → Appraisal → Perspective → Generation → Voice
```

## Key Concepts

- **Layer 1:** What's happening (agents, goals, events, stakes)
- **Layer 2:** Why they feel this way (six appraisal dimensions)
- **Layer 3:** Where emotion is heading (trajectory, vulnerabilities)
- **Layer 4:** How to respond (coherent patterns, voice guidance)

## Six Appraisal Dimensions

1. Goal Relevance
2. Goal Congruence
3. Coping Potential
4. Normative Significance
5. Self-Other Agency
6. Temporal Dynamics

## Six Vulnerabilities

1. Identity
2. Safety
3. Competence
4. Autonomy
5. Belonging
6. Meaning
